# AI-Powered Dynamic Road Network Optimization System (DRNOS)

---

## Project Overview

### DRNOS (Dynamic Road Network Optimization System)

DRNOS is an AI-powered traffic optimization platform designed to revolutionize urban mobility by dynamically managing road networks. This system leverages real-time data analytics, predictive modeling, and gamification strategies to reduce congestion, enhance compliance, and optimize resource allocation. Built with a strong emphasis on open-source technologies, DRNOS ensures seamless adaptability while maintaining full compliance with FOSS licensing standards.
